## UX


### Project Goals

Provide a simple but engaging user experience for someone interested in playing a general knowledge trivia game.

#### User goals

* Something quick, simple and engaging.
* Easily navigated user interface.
* Fun and challenging.
* Interesting variety of questions.
* Ability to save and check high scores.

#### User stories

* *"As a trivia game fan I expect to be appropriately challenged by the questions"*
* *"As a user I expect to be able to navigate straight into a game from the landing page"*
* *"As a competitive player I expect to be able to log my scores and compare them with those of others"*
* *"As a user I expect real time feedback to my input when I interact with the site"*
* *"As a user I expect to be able to play multiple times with a refreshed set of questions each time"*
* *"As a user I expect to have the option to leave a game in the middle"*
* *"As a user I expect to have the option to play again immediately when I finish"*

## Design Choices
* User interface situated centrally in the screen leaving lots of space outside of it to be used by background effect.
* [Particle](https://marcbruederlin.github.io/particles.js/) effect in the background to create interesting visual for the user reminiscent of DNA structures and sci-fi style interfaces.
* Particle effect responds to user input to increase feeling of interactivity. Speed and size swell with correct or incorrect answers.
* Less is more approach to avoid cluttering the UI with unnecessary features and icons.
* Indigo dye #1a4e6e and Honolulu blue #2c6e96 combine to make a [gradient background](https://cssgradient.io/)
* White #FFFFFF for the particle effect and font color.
* [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?sort=popularity&preview.text=Question+number+1+2+3+4+5+6&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open&selection.family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300) for font family.

### Wireframes


I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes for **mobile, tablet and desktop.**
