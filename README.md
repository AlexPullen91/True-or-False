## UX


### Project Goals

Provide a simple but engaging user experience for someone interested in playing a trivia game.

#### User goals

* Something quick, simple and engaging
* Easily navigated user interface
* Fun and challenging
* Interesting variety of questions

#### User stories

* "As a trivia game fan I expect to be appropriately challenged by the questions"
* "As a user I expect to be able to navigate straight into a game from the landing page"
* "As a competitive player I expect to be able to log my scores and compare them with those of others"
* "As a user I expect real time feedback to my input when I interact with the site"
* "As a user I expect to be able to play multiple times with a refreshed set of questions each time"
* "As a user I expect to have the option to leave a game in the middle"
* "As a user I expect to have the option to play again immediately when I finish"

## Design Choices
* User interface situated centrally in the screen leaving lots of space around the edges
* [Particle](https://marcbruederlin.github.io/particles.js/) effect in the background to create interesting visual for the user reminiscent of DNA structures and sci-fi interfaces. Speeds up and exands pending right or wrong answers
* Indigo dye #1a4e6e and Honolulu blue #2c6e96 combine to make a [gradient background](https://cssgradient.io/)
* White #FFFFFF for the particle effect and font color
* [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?sort=popularity&preview.text=Question+number+1+2+3+4+5+6&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open&selection.family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300) for font family

### Wireframes


I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes for **mobile, tablet and desktop.**

You can find my wireframes [here](https://github.com/AlexPullen91/True-or-False/tree/master/wireframes).
